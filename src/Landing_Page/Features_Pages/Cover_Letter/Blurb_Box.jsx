                Not all positions provide an opportunity to include a cover letter in your application, but when they do – our advice is to use that to your advantage! 
                Cover letters are a perfect time to distinguish yourself from the crowd by addressing why you’re interested in the role, what makes you uniquely qualified (outside of what is on your resume), 
                while providing an opportunity to demonstrate passion for the company and position for which you’re applying. It can also be the perfect place to address any potential questions or concerns in your resume, 
                such as extended gaps in employment or unusual circumstances.</p>
