                        Qualifications will often land the interview, but executing a successful meeting requires more than just possessing the right skills for the job. 
                        Whether your interview skills are rusty, it’s not something you enjoy, or for reasons you’re unaware of your interviews are not landing you the job, we can help. 
                        The average length of an interview is ~40 minutes, but some studies have shown that recruiters and hiring managers make their decision within the first two minutes of the interview. What is said in the interview is part of the equation, but your presentation, body language, and other factors can often mean the difference between landing the job of your dreams and missing out. 
                        Getting the interview is difficult enough – let us help you nail it!</p>
