                LinkedIn is utilized by recruiters and hiring managers in a number of different ways. 
                In some cases, it’s used to cross-reference information from a candidate’s resume – in other cases, 
                it’s utilized as a direct recruiting source. Having a complete LinkedIn profile that best represents your professional accomplishments – 
                and knowing what information decision makers are looking for – will only serve to enhance your job search. In fact, 
                for many recruiters and hiring managers, if you’re not on LinkedIn, it’s almost as if you don’t exist.
