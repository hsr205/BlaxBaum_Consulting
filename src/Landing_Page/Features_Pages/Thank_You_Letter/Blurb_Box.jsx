                Writing thank you notes after an interview has become a bit of a lost art – which is exactly why you should write them. 
                Sending a note can help you stand out from other candidates, by displaying appreciation, follow-through, and professionalism. 
                In fact, according to a recent CareerBuilder study, 22 percent of employers say they’re less likely to hire a candidate who doesn’t send a thank-you note – 
                and 56 percent said not doing so showed the candidate was not serious about the position. </p>
